            <article class="article">
                <p>Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, "Speculating on Everything," Print Magazine's "Observer: The "Critical Omissions" in PrintMag and Benjamin H. Bratton's "On Speculative Design" both examine the role of design from a new perspective. One of their shared beliefs is that <em>design shouldn't just make life easier or more beautiful; It should make us think critically and even inspire ideas about the future.</em></p>
                <p>In "Speculating on Everything," Dunn and Rabi explore "speculative design," a way for designers to create "what if" scenarios. These scenarios make us question our daily lives and imagine new ways of living. For them, <em>design is a tool</em> that challenges what we take for granted, encourages us to think about <em>big social issues</em>, and opens a conversation about <em>an alternative future</em>.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, The Observer: Critical Omission, focuses on the idea that design should not just meet the needs of the customer. It should also be used to <em>highlight social, ethical and environmental issues.</em> This type of design encourages the audience to think critically and reconsider social norms.</p>
                <p>Then, in On Speculative Design, Bratton pushes the boundaries even further. He believes that <em>design should not only meet human needs, but also consider the entire planet.</em> He advises designers to go beyond human-centered goals and think about the long-term impact of their work on the <em>environment, other species and future generations</em>.</p>
                <p>Together, these ideas show that <em>design can be a way to imagine new futures, challenge our assumptions, and spark important conversations.</em> Speculative design and critical design don't just solve today's problems, but act like a lens through which we can explore new possibilities for the future.</p>

                    Rather than just solving immediate problems, discursive design is more of a tool to lead people to think and discuss about future possibilities, helping us to see society and the future from a different perspective.
